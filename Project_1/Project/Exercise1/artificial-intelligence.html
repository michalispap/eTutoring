                <h5>Price: €89.99</h5>
                <h5>Course Description</h5>
                <p>Learn about one of the most powerful Deep Learning architectures yet!The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling.This includes time series analysis, forecasting and natural language processing (NLP).Learn about why RNNs beat old-school machine learning algorithms like Hidden Markov Models.This course focuses on "how to build and understand", not just "how to use". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about "remembering facts", it's about "seeing for yourself" via experimentation. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want more than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.

                <h4>Advanced AI: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python</h4>

                <h5>Price: €29.99</h5>
                <h5>Course Description</h5>
                <p>This course is all about the application of deep learning and neural networks to reinforcement learning.Specifically, the combination of deep learning with reinforcement learning has led to AlphaGo beating a world champion in the strategy game Go, it has led to self-driving cars, and it has led to machines that can play video games at a superhuman level.The world is changing at a very fast pace. The state of California is changing their regulations so that self-driving car companies can test their cars without a human in the car to supervise.Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are for analyzing and making predictions about data, whereas reinforcement learning is about training an agent to interact with an environment and maximize its reward.OpenAI is a non-profit founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman (Y Combinator), and others, in order to ensure that AI progresses in a way that is beneficial, rather than harmful.One of the great things about OpenAI is that they have a platform called the OpenAI Gym, which we’ll be making heavy use of in this course.
